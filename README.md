# MyReads Project Functionality

A simple app that lets you search, organise and catalog your books into reading lists.

The main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

 - Currently Reading 
 - Want to Read 
 - Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. 

Sort out your book shelves already!
